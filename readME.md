# Roshan Paudel - Portfolio Website

This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills and projects as a Full Stack Developer.

## Overview

The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with a focus on front-end). It features a clean, responsive design with a dark mode toggle and provides information about my skills, projects, and contact details.

## Features

- **Clean and Responsive Design:** The website adapts to various screen sizes.
- **Dark Mode Toggle:** Users can switch between light and dark themes.
- **Navigation Bar:** Easy navigation to different sections: Home, Skills, Projects, About, and Contact.
- **Hero Section:** Introduces me and offers a download link to my CV.
- **Skills Section:** Displays my technical skills with icons.
- **Projects Section:** Showcases my projects with screenshots and tech stack information.
- **About Me Section:** Provides a brief bio, location, and interests.
- **Contact Section:** Includes contact links and an email input form.
- **Footer:** Contains navigation and social links, and a copyright notice.
- **"Go Up" Button:** Allows users to quickly return to the top of the page.
- **Mobile Friendly Hamburger Menu:** Collapses the navigation menu for mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For structuring the content.
- **CSS3:** For styling and layout.
- **Font Awesome:** For icons.
- **Google Fonts:** For custom fonts.

## Getting Started

To view the website locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/roshanpaudel/gen-portfolio.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Roshan-Portfolio
    ```
    - **If your project folder has a different name, adjust the command accordingly.**
3.  **Open `index.html` in your web browser.**
    - You can do this by double-clicking the `index.html` file in your file explorer, or by right-clicking and selecting "Open with" and choosing your preferred browser.

**Important Note regarding CSS:**

- Ensure that the `style.css` file is located in the same directory as `index.html` or that the path to `style.css` in the `<link>` tag within `index.html` is correct. If the browser cannot locate the css file, the site will render without styles.

## File Structure

├── assets/
│ ├── GlideShift.JPG
│ ├── HikeCo.JPG
│ └── Roshan.png
├── index.html
└── style.css

- `index.html`: The main HTML file.
- `style.css`: The CSS stylesheet.
- `assets/`: Contains image files.

## Customization

- You can customize the content in `index.html` to reflect your own information.
- Modify the styles in `style.css` to change the appearance of the website.
- Replace the images in the `assets/` folder with your own project screenshots and profile picture.
- Add more projects to the project section by duplicating the project card html, and then adding new data.
- Adjust the color variables in the `:root` section of the css file, in order to rapidly change the color scheme.

## Future Improvements

- Add more projects and detailed descriptions.
- Implement a backend for the contact form.
- Improve responsiveness for even smaller screen sizes.
- Potentially add more javascript functionality.
- Add more detailed information to the readme.
